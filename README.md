A [Minecraft](minecraft.net) mod built on [Fabric](fabricmc.net).

This is a fork of "Bee Better": [GitHub](https://github.com/Draylar/bee-better) && [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bee-better)

Features:
* Wood beehives in all the vanilla wood textures
* An iron beehive "Apiary" which is essentially a double beehive
* A hive analyzer tool

I compiled this because I really liked the above feature set and wanted a mod that was just that, and nothing else.
